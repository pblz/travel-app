# Travel App

A Udacity Frontend Webdeveloper Nanodegree Project.

## Story
You can't travel but you can dream.
The app lets you plan virtual trips, by entering a destination, viewing the current weather forecast and browsing pictures other travellers took.
After viewing your trip results, you are able to save favorite destinations, and revisit them even after you closed your browser window..

## Setup
- Developed with node express.
- Built with webpack.
- Tested with jest.

## APIs used
Weatherbit for Weaterdata (Forecast and History)
Geonames for converting destinations to their longitude and latitude location.
Pixabay and Unsplash for pictures.
